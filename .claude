# Phone Order for WooCommerce - Claude Configuration

## Project Overview
This is a WordPress/WooCommerce plugin that enables quick order creation using just a customer's phone number.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards
- Use proper escaping: `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`
- Use proper sanitization: `sanitize_text_field()`, `wp_unslash()`
- Prefix all functions, classes, and hooks with `wc_phone_order_` or `WC_Phone_Order_`
- Use nonces for all AJAX requests
- Wrap debug code in `WP_DEBUG` checks

### File Structure
- `woo-phone-order.php` - Main plugin file
- `includes/settings.php` - Settings management
- `includes/settings-page.php` - WooCommerce settings tab

### Important Notes
- Plugin is HPOS (High Performance Order Storage) compatible
